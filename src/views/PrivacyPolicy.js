                <strong>Device Permissions for Personal Data Access.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our application requests certain permissions from users that
                allow it to access the user's device data as described below.
              </p>
              <p>
                By default, these permissions must be granted by the user before
                the respective information can be accessed. Once the permission
                has been given, it can be revoked by the User at any time. In
                order to revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device
                settings or contact the owner for support at the contact details
                provided in the present document.
              </p>
              <p>
                The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may be
                dependent on the user's device and software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that the revoking of such permissions might impact
                the proper functioning of this Application.
              </p>
              <p>
                If user grants any of the permissions listed below, these
                respective Personal Data may be processed (i.e accessed to,
                modified or removed) by this application.

                Used for accessing the User's approximate device location. Our
                application may collect, use, and share User location Data in
                order to provide location-based services. The geographic
                location of the User is determined in a manner that isn't
                continuous. This means that it is impossible for our application
                to derive the approximate position of the User on a continuous
                basis.

                Used for accessing the User's precise device location. Our
                application may collect, use, and share User location Data in

                <li>
                  let us have proof of your identity and address (a copy of your

                <strong>How long will my information be retained for?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only keep hold of your data for as long as it is
                required by CeX to continue both a relationship with yourself
                and to fall in line with Legal requirements which include but
                not limited to Law Enforcement partnerships and 24 month
                warranties.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Where your personal information is held?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Information may be held at our offices and those of our group
                companies, franchisees, third party agencies, service providers,
                representatives and agents as described above.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of these third parties may be based outside the European
                Economic Area. For more information, including on how we
                safeguard your personal information when this occurs, see below:
                ‘Transferring your personal information out of the EEA’.

                  Transferring your personal information out of the EEA
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to
                share your personal information outside the European Economic
                Area (EEA), eg:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>with our offices outside the EEA;</li>
                <li>
                  with your and our service providers located outside the EEA;
                </li>
                <li>if you are based outside the EEA;</li>
                <li>
                  where there is an international dimension to the services we
                  are providing to you.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These transfers are subject to special rules under European and
                UK data protection law.
                <br />
                Some non-EEA countries do not have the same data protection laws
                as the United Kingdom and EEA. We will, however, ensure the
                transfer complies with data protection law and all personal
                information will be secure. Our standard practice is to use
                standard data protection contract clauses that have been
                approved by the European Commission. To obtain a copy of those
                clauses please contact our Data Protection Officer (see ‘How to
                contact us’ below).
